# Gamer-Group-I310D-Project
A data science group project by the "Gamer Group" (Alexander Ibrahim, Keegan Fleigner, & Shasa Kolur) for our I310D course at UT Austin. The goal of the project was to find a dataset and preforms some operations to accept or reject a hypothesis, test an ML model or some other data science work. Gamer Group choose a dataset of Chicago Taxis and looked at change in travel time over the day (bivarble) as well as overlap between start and stop locations (kmeans clustering).
